## Instructions

The game has already been built into the **live** folder. If you'd like to make this game your own, edit the files within the **src** folder.

To get started, you'll first need to get gulp up and running. Follow these steps:

1) Ensure Node JS is install on your system (As this will come with the required npm).

2) Open your command line/ git console. Make sure to travel to the folder that this repository is in.

3) Run the function `npm install`. Once this is finnished, than run `npm install gulp -g`

4) Once everything is installed, you just need to use the function gulp. You'll be able to start editing the source code, and it'll create the required hostable files in the test folder.

5) Once you're done, run `gulp dist`. This will create the distribution ready code of your custom memory game.

I hope you enjoy this build. Always happy to receive input and ideas.
